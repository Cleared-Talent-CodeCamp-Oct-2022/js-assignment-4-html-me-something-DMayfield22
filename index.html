            <h2>Should anyone be able to own or patent genetic information? </h2>
            <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">If a company holds a gene patent, they own the rights to research and test on that gene which is not always the best course of action unless they are researching advances in curing diseases that there is not much knowledge on, but to freely own genetic information that is not yours, is not a good idea. 
               Doing the research to advance modern medicine using someone’s genetic information, with their consent, is a great idea but without their consent is asking for a lawsuit, and it is a lawsuit because you did nothing to create the content of the gene, so you own absolutely zero rights to it. 
               You can’t own something that is naturally made because you are unable to reproduce that exact genetic information that you bought, which is why it was bought it. 
               You should not be able to own or patent genetic information</p>

            <h2>  Would you be willing to “share” your genetic information to advance science? Should doctors, the government, insurance companies, or anyone else have access to a person’s genetic profile? </h2>
            <p>If I had a disease or a disease that there was not much knowledge on, I would share my genetic information for a good price. 
               It wouldn’t be for free, just like giving birth at a hospital is not free, and I don’t think any doctor’s, insurance companies, 23and me, the government or anyone should have access to a person’s genetic profile. 
               The only reason I would share my genetic information is if it was to help the greater good. 
               I am known for being cynical because I do believe some of the professionals in today’s society are not motivated for advancement for the right reasons, it is more so for money, fame, or recognition instead of helping the greater good or having a solid belief of why we practice science. </p>

         <h2>What does the law say about your personal genetic data?</h2>
            <p>According to the Federal Trade Commission: Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing has grown increasingly popular in recent years, and its use is expected to expand.
               Companies analyze individuals’ DNA and can provide information regarding a person’s genetic ancestry or possible genetic risk for certain health conditions.
               In addition to companies that sequence individuals’ DNA directly, more companies now offer their own analysis or digital health services to consumers who upload their genetic information. 
               DTC genetic tests have limited regulation, and the growth of the DTC genetic testing industry has resulted in vast databases of consumers’ genetic information, raising serious privacy concerns. 
               While many companies have robust privacy and informed consent policies, no federal laws prohibit companies from providing individuals’ genetic information to third parties. 
               However, the Federal Trade Commission provides some protections and can take enforcement action against companies that make false or misleading statements regarding data privacy and security or companies that fail to protect individuals’ information. 
               Importantly, if an individual chooses to download their genetic information from one of these services or upload it to another, the company that originally collected the data is no longer responsible for any breach of privacy that may occur.</p>
